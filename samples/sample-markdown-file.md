# Sample Markdown File

This is a sample markdown file for testing your text chunker program. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.

## Second Paragraph

Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. It supports various formatting elements like **bold text**, *italics*, [links](https://example.com), and code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

You can also create lists:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
