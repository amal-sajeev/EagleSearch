This is a sample text file for testing your text chunker program. Plain text files are simple but effective for storing unformatted text data. They are widely used for storing logs, notes, and other textual information.

Text files can contain multiple paragraphs and are easily processed by most programming languages. This makes them ideal for testing text processing applications like your chunker program. You can modify this content as needed to test different scenarios or edge cases in your program.
